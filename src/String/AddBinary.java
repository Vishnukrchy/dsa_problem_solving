Problem Understanding:
We are given two binary strings, a and b. Our task is to add them and return the result as a binary string.

Understanding Binary Addition
Binary addition follows these rules:
0 + 0 = 0
0 + 1 = 1
1 + 0 = 1
1 + 1 = 10  (0 is stored, carry 1)
1 + 1 + 1 = 11 (1 is stored, carry 1
Example 1:

Input: a = "11", b = "1"
Output: "100"
Example 2:

Input: a = "1010", b = "1011"
Output: "10101"
