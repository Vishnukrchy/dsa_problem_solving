Q1 Write Query to find  2nd highest salary from Employee table
Ans -:
SELECT MAX(salary) AS SecondHighestSalary
FROM Employee
WHERE salary < (SELECT MAX(salary) FROM Employee);

Q2 Write Query to find 2nd highest salary from Employee table using LIMIT
Ans -:
SELECT salary AS SecondHighestSalary
FROM Employee
ORDER BY salary DESC
LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1;
explanation -:
limit 1 is used to limit the result to one row, and offset 1 skips the first row, effectively giving us the second highest salary.
offset is used in sql to skip a specified number of rows before starting to return rows from the query result.
Q3 Write Query to find 2nd highest salary from Employee table using DENSE_RANK
Ans -:
WITH RankedSalaries AS (
    SELECT salary, DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) AS rank
    FROM Employee
)
explanation -:
SELECT salary AS SecondHighestSalary is used to select the salary column from the RankedSalaries CTE.
WHERE rank = 2; is used to filter the results to only include the row with a rank of 2, which corresponds to the second highest salary.
here we are using DENSE_RANK() to assign a rank to each salary in descending order, ensuring that if there are duplicate salaries, they receive the same rank.
 and common table expression (CTE) is used to create a temporary result set that can be referenced within the main query.
